I'm gonna ask for leave, and find a new job

fear:

1.  indudge myself if left alone, in really bad shape, worse than even now
2.  can't really find a job that worth working for, my age, my knowledge, etc.
3.  need to rent a place to stay / staying at home is a downhill spiral, only getting worse
4.

solutions to my fear:

1.

2.  working on side projects. Build my resume. Knowing how to build a whole thing.

benefits:

1.

cost of remain here:

short term(what is really bad for you now)

1.  working on meaningless work
2.  chaotic workplace and dorm
3.  trash food
4.  no good coleagues that you could discuss and learn from

long term(what you become if keep staying here for 1 more year)
