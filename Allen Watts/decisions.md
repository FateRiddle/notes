You do not know where your decisions come from, they pop up like hiccups

And when you make decisions, people have a great deal of anxiety about making decisions
Did I think over this long enough? Did I take enough data into consideration?

And if you think it through, you find, you could never take enough data into consideration:
The data for a decision in any given situation if infinate

So what you do is, you go through the motions of thinking out what you will do about this
but worries are people who think of all the variables beyond their control, what might happen

Choice is the act of hesitation that we make before making a decision,
it is a mental wobbling, and so we are always in a desert of doubt as whether we are behaving in the right way, doing the right thing, so on and so forth, and lack certain kind of self-confidence

And if you, see, you lack self-confidence, you will make mistake through sheer fumbling, if you do have self-confidence, you may carry get away with doing entirely the wrong thing

You have to regard yourself as a cloud, in the flesh. Because, you see, clouds never make mistakes
Did you see a cloud that was misshapen? Did you see a badly designed wave? No, they always do the right thing

But if you will treat yourself for a while as a cloud or wave and realize that you can't make a mistake, whatever you do,
because even if you do something that seems to be totally disastrous, it'll all come out in the wash somehow or other,
then through this capacity you will develop a kind of confidence, and through confidence you will be able to trust your own intuition

Now this is the middle way of knowing it has nothing to do with your decision to do this or not,
whether you decide that you can make a mistake or whether you don't decide, it's true anyway, you are like cloud and water

And through that realization, without overcompensating in the other direction, you will begin to be on good terms with your own being and to be able to trust your own brain

Every path is the right path
